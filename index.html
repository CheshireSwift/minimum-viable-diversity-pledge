            <strong>All-Male Events</strong>
        </h1>

        <p>
            Speakers at professional events in every field should represent
            the diversity of their community, so everybody can be included
            and inspired by the cutting edge of their domain.
        </p><p>
            Too many though don't represent any diversity at all.
        </p><p>
            We want to take specific concrete action to improve this,<br/>
            starting with ending male-only events,<br/>
            <strong>and we need your help.</strong>

            <p>
                By signing a pledge above, you're committing to not supporting or creating paid events that
                don't feature any diverse gender representation whatsoever (this is a low bar for a
                reason: see <a href="#tell-me-more">Tell Me More</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Committing to that alone isn't a huge step though; just by being here, you're already
                unlikely to fall foul of this. The magic comes when you start actively ensuring that
                commitment:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    As a speaker, when you confirm your slot <strong>tell organisers you'd love to
                    come speak for them, but you won't be able to if they end up with an all-male lineup.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an attendee, before you get tickets <strong>ask organisers to confirm
                    they won't have an all-male lineup</strong> (and don't buy tickets if they already do).
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an organiser, <strong>dedicate time and resources to ensuring diversity in your event
                    and panel lineups</strong>, and tell speakers &amp; attendees about your commitment to
                    this pledge before your final lineup is published.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a company, <strong>ask employees attending events to check they don't have an
                    all-male lineup in advance</strong>, and suggest alternative events if they do.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>
                For more information on this, see <a href="#resources">resources</a> below.
            </em></p>

            <p>
                Each step here builds a culture where it becomes clearly unacceptable for an event to
                ignore gender diversity entirely, as many now do. When organisers have a significant
                chunk of their speakers warn them they'll have to drop out if there's an all-male
                lineup, and whole batches of attendees asking them to confirm that in advance, it
                becomes untenable to ignore the issue, and with a minimal bar it's impossible to
                deny its validity.

            <h2 id="tell-me-more">Tell me more</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>We believe meetups and conferences should be representative of their
                community</strong>. A disappointing number though not only fail at this, but fail to
                represent any gender diversity whatsoever. Tiny meetups and unfunded volunteer-run events
                often have very limited resources and time so this can be a difficult problem to resolve,
                and while we encourage them to do what they can, that doesn't merit rejecting them outright.
            </p><p>
                Events that charge for entry however are a different matter: <strong>we believe any event
                large and successful enough to charge for tickets has the power to provide an inclusive
                environment and a responsibility to do so</strong>, by investing some of their revenue and
                time back into their speaker selection, to guarantee at least a minimum level of gender
                diversity.
            </p><p>
                This pledge aims to raise the lower limit on diversity at these events, and by doing so
                improve overall diversity even further. By focusing on a minimum level that we can
                all agree clearly indicates a major problem, we make it as easy as possible for attendees,
                speakers and organisations to commit to this pledge, and with this driving community
                uptake <strong>we aim to make it untenable to run a paid event whilst completely ignoring
                your responsibilities to diverse representation</strong>.
            </p><p>
                We hope this will not only ensure that all events reach this minimum bar, but puts
                them in a good position to go further, and builds clear momentum and pressure to do
                so for all events, even those already reaching this basic level.
            </p><p>
                <strong>Gender is not the only important form of diversity where many events fail to
                reflect their community</strong>, but we've chosen to focus here on gender initially to
                maximise the applicability of this pledge.
            </p><p>
                While the gender makeup of communities is relatively consistent around the world,
                and male speakers are consistently over-represented, diversity in other aspects of
                communities (such as ethnicity and religion) is far more complex and varies widely,
                making it far harder to draw a clear line for minimally acceptable diversity that is
                always appropriate.
            </p><p>
                <strong>The key goal of this pledge is to make a strong and immediately practical first step</strong>,
                hoping that momentum here will encourage and enable wider developments in the future,
                extending both beyond just minimal diversity, and beyond gender diversity alone.
                We're keen to continue to extend this in future to do so, and very open to
                ideas on how to do so most effectively.
