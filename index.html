        </h1>

        <p>
            Professional events need to be inclusive, by representing a diverse
            range of speakers, so everybody can be involved with and inspired
            by the cutting edge of their domain.
        </p><p>
            Too many though don't represent any diversity <em>at all</em>.
        </p><p>
            We want to take concrete action to fix this, from the bottom up.<br/>
            We want to end totally homogeneous events,<br/>
            <strong>and we need your help.</strong>

            <h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work?</h2>

            <p>
                By signing a pledge above, you're committing to not supporting or creating paid events that
                don't feature any diverse representation whatsoever (this is a low bar for a
                reason: see <a href="#tell-me-more">Tell Me More</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Just promising not to do that isn't a huge step though, on its own. If you're reading this,
                you're probably not going to fall foul of this intentionally anyway. The magic comes
                when you start actively ensuring that commitment:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    As a speaker, when you confirm your slot <strong>tell organisers you'd love to
                    come speak for them, but you won't be able to if their lineup doesn't have any
                    speaker diversity.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an attendee, before you get tickets <strong>ask organisers to confirm
                    they'll have some diversity in their lineup</strong> (and don't buy tickets if
                    it's already published, and they don't).
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an organiser, <strong>dedicate time and resources to ensuring diversity in your event
                    and panel lineups</strong>, and tell speakers &amp; attendees about your commitment to
                    this pledge before your final lineup is published.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a company, <strong>ask employees attending events to check they have some
                    diversity in their lineup in advance</strong>, and suggest alternative events
                    if they don't.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>
                For more information on this, see <a href="#resources">resources</a> below.
            </em></p>

            <p>
                Each step here builds a culture that makes it unacceptable for an event to
                ignore diversity, as too many do (<a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">some</a>
                <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/24/female-chemists-protest-all-male-conference-lineup">
                illustrative</a>
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/07/tory-conference-fringe-events-all-male-panels">examples</a>).
            </p><p>
                When organisers have big groups of speakers warn them they'll have to
                drop out if they don't have any speaker diversity, and whole batches of attendees
                asking them to confirm that in advance, it stops being possible to ignore the issue.
                With an embarassingly low bar it's hard to argue it's ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a concrete step on diversity, help shut down the worst offenders,
                and make it inconceivable to run a paid event that ignores its responsibilities.<br/>

                    <p>
                        Spread the word! Share the pledge around, tell conferences and your employer and
                        your friends about it, and help us get as many people involved as possible, so
                        we can make maximum impact.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why is this important?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Diverse groups solve problems better</strong>.
                        <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/">
                        We've done studies</a>, it's measurably true, and aiming for a diverse mix of genders,
                        races, religions, sexualities &amp; more everywhere makes us all more successful,
                        and the world a better place.
                    </p><p>
                        This is important in communities generally, but especially for people in leading
                        role-model positions, such as speakers at industry events. More diverse groups of
                        speakers will give us conference talks and discussion with a wider range of
                        ideas, but more importantly will also include &amp; inspire more diverse audiences.
                    </p><p>
                        It's this multiplier effect that's key. More diverse lineups let everybody get
                        involved in the cutting-edge of the field, help spread diversity in the
                        community as a whole, and hopefully inspire more diverse groups of people to
                        share their ideas on stage too.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>What do you mean by 'diverse' speakers?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        The short answer: <strong>it depends, but the key is to highlight a range of voices
                        from a variety of backgrounds, especially those who aren't normally heard.</strong>
                    </p><p>
                        Diversity is a complicated topic, and it's going to depend on the context. You may
                        have to make your own call on this. Most of the time though it's pretty
                        clear when you have no meaningful diversity at all, and it's the clearly failing cases
                        that this pledge is most concerned with. When your whole lineup is white men, there's a
                        clear problem. If you have a lineup that instead includes some women, people of colour,
                        LGBT people, and people with disabilities, you've gained some level of diversity.
                    </p><p>
                        Existing represention of the groups in question is key. The
                        groups to focus on are those who are otherwise frequently discriminated against,
                        and are different to the typical speakers you'd see at your event. Adding
                        somebody British to a lineup of Americans typically doesn't add any meaningful
                        diversity. Adding somebody from Latin America often would.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why a minimum bar?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        By focusing on the minimum level, <strong>we want to get as many people
                        as possible involved, so that it becomes a common sight for organisers
                        everywhere, so nobody can run events that totally ignore diversity</strong>. If
                        you want to make a concrete pledge to solve a widespread issue that's also practical
                        for as many people as possible to sign up to, you can't rule out the majority
                        of existing events. You need to focus first on the clear worst offenders, and
                        build up from there.
                    </p><p>
                        The hope here is that this will cause big problems for those below the minimum
                        bar, and in addition the steady pressure from many pledge signers mentioning it
                        when accepting speaking slots and buying tickets will highlight diversity further,
                        even among events already reaching this line. This builds awareness and momentum
                        across the board to improve diversity even further, everywhere.
                    </p><p>
                        This is just the start though. <strong>You personally don't need to limit yourself to
                        pushing for this minimal bar</strong>, and we'd encourage you to go even further
                        (see <a href="#resources">resources</a> for some suggestions).
                        In future we also hope to extend beyond this, to steadily raise the bar
                        and improve diversity more and more. For now though this pledge is focused
                        on taking a practical and immediate step forward, with a long road ahead.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why only paid events?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Diversity is important, and every event should have a diverse lineup.</strong>
                        Many free events are tiny meetups organised by volunteers though, with tiny lineups,
                        and barely enough time or resources to actively find <em>any</em> speakers, let
                        alone go further and encourage diverse speakers (see <a href="#resources">resources</a>
                        for some tips on doing this). These events do need to be more inclusive too,
                        but outright boycotts across the board for these rules out many events that can't
                        easily invest more effort to go further. Including these events in this pledge
                        makes it impossible for many people to sign up.
                    </p><p>
                        Events that charge for entry are a different matter: <strong>any event
                        large &amp; successful enough to charge for tickets has the power to provide an inclusive
                        environment, and a responsibility to do so</strong>. These events need to be investing
                        some of their revenue and time back into their speaker selection to guarantee at
                        least a minimum level of gender diversity, and many aren't. This is where we're focusing.
                    </p><p>
                        <strong>You personally don't have to limit this to only paid events</strong>
                        though. This is the minimum general bar: feel free to go further
                        and push for more (and see <a href="#resources">resources</a> if you'd like
                        some ideas for ways to do that).
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>What will you do with signups?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        Mainly just publish how many of them we get, so everybody can see how many
                        people think this is important.
                    </p><p>
                        The pledges also ask you for your name (or your company/events name and logo).
                        We're planning to eventually publish a list of the people who've signed up, and
                        include a selection of event and company logos on the site.
                        This is optional though, so feel free to skip it if you'd rather not be included.
                    </p><p>
                        Finally, we also optionally collect email addresses. We'll never share these or
                        spam them. They're only going to be used for very occasional later updates closely
                        related to this pledge.
