        </h1>

        <p>
            Speakers at professional events in every field should represent
            the diversity of their community, so everybody can be included
            and inspired by the cutting edge of their domain.
        </p><p>
            Too many though don't represent any diversity <em>at all</em>.
        </p><p>
            We want to take specific concrete action to improve this<br/>
            from the bottom up, to stop totally homogeneous events,<br/>
            <strong>and we need your help.</strong>

            <h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work?</h2>

            <p>
                By signing a pledge above, you're committing to not supporting or creating paid events that
                don't feature any diverse representation whatsoever (this is a low bar for a
                reason: see <a href="#tell-me-more">Tell Me More</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Committing to that alone isn't a huge step though; just by being here, you're already
                unlikely to fall foul of this intentionally. The magic comes when you start actively
                ensuring that commitment:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    As a speaker, when you confirm your slot <strong>tell organisers you'd love to
                    come speak for them, but you won't be able to if their lineup doesn't have a diverse
                    range of speakers.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an attendee, before you get tickets <strong>ask organisers to confirm
                    they'll have some diversity in their lineup</strong> (and don't buy tickets if
                    it's already published, and they don't).
                </li>
                <li>
                    As an organiser, <strong>dedicate time and resources to ensuring diversity in your event
                    and panel lineups</strong>, and tell speakers &amp; attendees about your commitment to
                    this pledge before your final lineup is published.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a company, <strong>ask employees attending events to check they have some
                    diversity in their lineup in advance</strong>, and suggest alternative events
                    if they don't.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>
                For more information on this, see <a href="#resources">resources</a> below.
            </em></p>

            <p>
                Each step here builds a culture where it becomes unacceptable for an event to
                ignore diversity, as too many do.
            </p><p>
                When organisers have a significant chunk of their speakers warn them they'll have to
                drop out if they don't have any speaker diversity, and whole batches of attendees
                asking them to confirm that in advance, it stops being possible to ignore the issue,
                and with a minimal bar it's hard to argue it's ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a concrete step on diversity to completely shut down the worst offenders,
                and make it inconceivable to run a paid event that ignores its responsibilities.

                    <p>
                        Spread the word! Share the pledge around, tell conferences and your employer and
                        your friends about it, and help us get as many people involved as possible, so
                        we can make maximum impact.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why is this important?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        Diverse groups solve problems better. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/">
                        We've done studies</a>, it's measurably true, and aiming for a diverse mix of genders,
                        races, religions, sexualities and more in every field will make all of us more successful.
                    </p><p>
                        This is important in communities generally, but especially for people in leading
                        role-model positions, such as speakers at industry events. Higher diversity of
                        speakers helps to fill conference talks and discussion with a wider range of
                        ideas, but more importantly it also includes and inspires more diverse audiences.
                        It's this multiplier effect that's key. More diverse lineups let everybody get
                        involved in the cutting-edge of the field, helping spread diversity in the
                        community as a whole, and hopefully inspiring more diverse groups of people to
                        sharing their ideas on stage too.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why only paid events?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        Diversity is important, and every event should have a diverse lineup. We're setting
                        a minimum acceptable line though here though (see '<em>Why a minimum bar</em>&nbsp;?' below)
                        for events that we can all agree aren't ok, to force them to improve.
                    </p><p>
                        Any event that can charge for entry has the resources and time to do that, and
                        a responsibility to do so, and we want to make sure that happens.
                        Many free events are tiny meetups organised by volunteers though, who often barely have the time
                        and resources to do <em>anything</em>. We'd love them to go further too, but outright boycotts
                        across the board for these would rule out many events that can't easily invest
                        any more effort to go further, and including them in this pledge makes it much
                        harder for many people to sign up to it.
                    </p><p>
                        This doesn't mean that you personally have to limit this to just paid events
                        though. This is the minimum general bar for everybody: feel free to go further
                        and push for more yourself (and see Resources if you'd like some ideas for ways
                        to do that).
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Why a minimum bar?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        By focusing on the minimum level, we want to make this a pledge that as many people
                        as possible can commit to, so that it becomes a common sight for event organisers
                        everywhere, so it becomes impossible to run an event that ignores this issue. If
                        you want to make a concrete pledge to solve a widespread issue that's practical
                        for as many people as possible to sign up to, you need to focus first on the clear
                        worst offenders.
                    </p><p>
                        With a minimum bar like this the pledge doesn't rule out an impractical number of events.
                        The hope here is that this will cause big problems for those below the minimum
                        bar, and in addition the steady pressure from many pledge signers mentioning it
                        when accepting speaking slots and buying tickets will highlight diversity further
                        even among events already reaching this line, to build awareness and momentum across
                        the board and improve diversity even further.
                    </p><p>
                        This is just the start though. In future we hope to extend this to steadily
                        raise the bar further and improve diversity in more aspects, but for now this
                        pledge is focused on taking an immediate and practical first step.
                    </p>
                </dd>

                <dt>What will you do with signups?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>
                        Mainly just publish how many of them we get, so everybody can see how many
                        people think this is important.
                    </p><p>
                        The pledges also ask you for your name (or your company/events name and logo).
                        We're planning to eventually publish a list of the people who've signed up, and
                        include a selection of event and company logos on the site.
                        This is optional though, so feel free to skip it if you'd rather not be included.
                    </p><p>
                        Finally, we also optionally collect email addresses. We'll never share these or
                        spam them. They're only going to be used for very occasional later updates closely
                        related to this pledge.
